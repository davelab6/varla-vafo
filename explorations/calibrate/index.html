    <h1>Calibrate CSS</h1>

    <p>This article is inspired by a
    <a href ="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614">comment by
    @frivoal on w3c/csswg-drafts#614</a>, a discussion on the Topic
    "<strong>[css-values] Ability to address actual physical size #614 </strong>":
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[…]</p>
        <p>It is possible that most members of the CSSWG and most browser
        engineers are wrong, that there's a big flaw in the collective
        reasoning, and that one way or another, this is actually a good
        idea. If you think so, start by understanding the arguments against,
        then build a strong case debunking them, and explain why you're right.</p>
        <p>Merely stating that there's no downside isn't going to be convincing.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Disclosure</h3>
    <p>As of beginning this, I don't know if a good case can be build, but
    I'm instinctively biased towards having the ability to use real world
    physical sizes in CSS.</p>

    <h3>Contribute</h3>
    <p>I understand this as an open document, meaning that contributions
    are welcome via the <a href="https://github.com/graphicore/varla-vafo/issues">GitHub
    issue tracker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphicore/varla-vafo/blob/main/explorations/calibrate/index.html">Pull
    Requests on the actual document</a>. But this openness also means it's
    possible, even likely, that the article changes over time. The change
    history can be examined via git, but when quoting, it may still be a
    good idea to keep the current git commit hash of the source document.

    <h2>Calibration of Browser Length-Units</h2>

    <p>In an <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614#issuecomment-611217635">#614
    issue comment</a> @tabatkins describes a calibration page:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>Notably, this would basically be:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have a calibration page, where you ask the user to measure
        the distance between two lines that are some CSS distance apart
        (say, <code>10cm</code>), and input the value they get.</li>
        <li>Use this to find the scaling factor necessary for that screen
        (CSS length divided by user-provided length), and store it locally
        (via localStorage, or a cookie, etc).</li>
        <li>On the pages where you need the accurate length, fetch it from
        local storage, and set a <code>--unit-scale: 1.07;</code> (subbing
        in the real value) property on the <code>html</code> element.</li>
        <li>Anywhere you use a length that needs to be accurate, instead of
        <code>width: 5cm;</code>, write
        <code>width: calc(5cm * var(--unit-scale, 1));</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is a robust and minimal calibration scheme that will
    "fail open" - if the user hasn't calibrated, or clears local data, or
    has JS turned off, it'll just use standard CSS units (due to the , 1
    default arg for the unit scale), rather than breaking.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I build that calibration device as a widget into this page:<br>
        <button class="ui-init-calibrate">click this button to calibrate</button>.
    </p>
    <p>Note: no persistence/local storage of the calibration yet.</p>
    <p>The result is stored in CSS on <code>:root</code> as <code>--unit-scale-adjust</code>.</p>


    <p>CAVEAT: the example works only for square pixels. It's generally
    possible to calibrate width and height separately.</p>

    <p>
        One real centimeter: <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1cm; height: 1cm; background: black"></span>
        One real inch: <span style="display: inline-block; width: 1in; height: 1in; background: black"></span>
    <p>

    <quote>
    The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with
    a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm’s
    length. For a nominal arm’s length of 28 inches [71,12 centimeters], the visual angle
    is therefore about 0.0213 degrees. For reading at arm’s length,
    1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).
    </quote>

    Therefore, on your device the reading distance to have one
    CSS-inch to appear at an visual angle of 0.0213 degrees is: <span class="insert insert-normal-reading-distance"></span>



    <p><em>Note to me</em>
    The behavior of the "auto" algorithm of
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-size-adjust"><code>text-size-adjust</code></a>
    is a case where we need a good automation in <code>font-optical-sizing</code>
    to automatically adjust, <code>font-variation-settings</code> won't do it in that case.

        more use cases:
          - print proofing/designer preview. We can help reducing paper
            wastage!
          - Effective web proofing by correctly scaling to actual
            e.g. phone-screen sizes.
          - optical size proofing for type design
          - getting an impression what the default viewing distance is
            supposed to be on certain devices, as it is not easy to to
            do on the spot.

          - touch device UI must be touched with physical fingers,
            hence controls designed with physical sizes are best practice.

          - the web platform usage diversifies as it is becoming more ubiquitous.

          - the web platform is becoming more ubiquitous, not all use cases
            fit well into the "reference pixel" approach. Sometimes
            target screen and viewing distance could be very well known
            and hence a direct way of designing for these target could be
            desirable. In web, the flexibility of the CSS-unit approach
            requires that there's a scroll somewhere. Paged media can't
            afford this. Where a user can't scroll, e.g. a digital poster
            on a screen, that is not interactive, pages become important
            and alse that the designer can control the viewing distance
            assumptions. <!-- Clames like this need backup! it's also just
            not a good argument yet and may have false statements, definitely
            not all strong points.
            -->
          - We can control for different device sizes even when designing
            with real world units, though a support in media-queries would
            help a lot.
          - hi-res screens are so good now, we can anchor to physical units
            and won't get blurry lines.

          - what about e.g. font-sizes for legal print, are there absolute
            requirements? "legible" is one of them, but fonts becoming regularly
            smaller than e.g. 12 pt because the device defaults to 20 inches
            viewing distance instead of 28 inches may be unfortunate.

    <!-- On my tiny iPhone 6 SE calibration doesn't work like this.
    It scales wildly around depending of content size, and then it doesn't
    return to the same min scale factor as when measuring.

    FIXME: Seems like this way landscape orientation uses another scale as
    portrait.

    <h1>Calibration of Browser Length-Units</h1>
    <p>Last week, I was shocked discovering the state of optical sizes for
    variable fonts on the web. ...
    </p>

    <p>A complete example: calibration widget and calibration integration.
    Especially demonstrating how typographic optical sizes behave with
    correct, physical sizes and experimenting with adjustments for viewing
    distance.</p>
    <p>CAVEAT: the example works only for square pixels. It's generally
    possible to calibrate width and height separately. Contact me if there's
    actual demand.</p>
    <p>First things first, click this button:

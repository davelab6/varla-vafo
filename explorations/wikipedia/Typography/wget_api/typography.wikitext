'''Typography''' is the art and technique of [[typesetting|arranging type]] to make [[written language]] [[legibility|legible]], [[readability|readable]] and [[beauty|appealing]] when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting [[typeface]]s, [[Point (typography)|point sizes]], [[line length]]s, line-spacing ([[leading]]), and [[letter-spacing]] (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters ([[kerning]]<ref>Bringhurst, Robert. ''The Elements of Typographic Style'', version 3.1. Canada: Hartley & Marks, 2005. p. 32.</ref>). The term ''typography'' is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. [[Type design]] is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.<ref>{{Citation | last = Pipes | first = Alan | title = Production For Graphic Designers | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Prentice-Hall]] | year = 1997}}</ref><ref name="Berry, J 2004">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=John D.|title=dot-font: Being a Typographer |url=http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-being-a-typographer |website= CreativePro |publisher= Creative Publishing Network and CreativePro |access-date=7 April 2015|date=16 August 2004}}</ref> Typography also may be used as an ornamental and decorative device, unrelated to the communication of information.

Typography is the work of [[typesetting|typesetters]] (also known as [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositors]]), typographers, [[graphic designer]]s, [[art director]]s, [[manga artist]]s, [[comic book artist]]s, [[graffiti artist]]s, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from [[clerical worker]]s and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials. Until the [[Information Age|Digital Age]], typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users. As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished {{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve its principal objective: effective communication.

== Etymology ==
The word "typography" in English comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots {{lang|grc|τύπος}} {{transl|grc|typos}} ('impression') and {{lang|grc|-γραφία}} {{transl|grc|-graphia}} ('writing').

Although typically applied to printed, published, broadcast, and reproduced materials in contemporary times, all words, letters, symbols, and numbers written alongside the earliest naturalistic drawings by humans may be called typography. The word, ''typography'', is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words τύπος ''typos'' "form" or "impression" and γράφειν ''graphein'' "to write", traces its origins to the first [[Punch (numismatics)|punches]] and [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] used to make [[Seal (device)|seals]] and [[currency]] in [[ancient history|ancient times]], which ties the concept to printing. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the [[Mesopotamian]] cities of [[Uruk]] and [[Larsa]], dating from the [[second millennium B.C.]], may be evidence of type, wherein the reuse of identical characters was applied to create cuneiform text.<ref name="brickstamps">{{cite book|last1=Sass|first1=Benjamin|last2=Marzahn|first2=Joachim |title=Aramaic and Figural Stamp Impressions on Bricks of the Sixth Century B.C. from Babylon|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06184-1|pages=11, 20, 160|quote="the latter has cuneiform signs that look as if made with a movable type, and impressions from Assur display the same phenomenon}}</ref> Babylonian [[cylinder seal]]s were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.<ref name="Clair" /> Typography was also implemented in the [[Phaistos Disc]], an enigmatic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] printed item from [[Crete]], which dates to between 1850 and 1600 B.C.<ref name="Brekle1997">{{Citation | last = Brekle | first = Herbert E | author-link = Herbert E.

Typography with [[movable type]] was invented during the eleventh-century [[Song dynasty]] in China by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051).<ref name="needham">{{cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Needham |title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=14|isbn=978-0-521-32995-8|quote=Bi Sheng... who first devised, about 1045, the art of printing with movable type}}</ref> His movable type system was manufactured from ceramic materials, and clay type printing continued to be practiced in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]].

[[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] was one of the pioneers of wooden movable type. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down and the types could be replaced only by carving new pieces.<ref name=ts>{{cite book |last=Tsien |first=Tsuen-Hsuin |author-link=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |title=Paper and Printing |volume=vol. 5 part 1 |series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn= 978-0-521-08690-5|pages=201–217}}</ref>

Metal movable type was first invented in Korea during the [[Goryeo|Goryeo Dynasty]], approximately 1230. [[Hua Sui]] introduced bronze type printing to China in 1490 AD. The diffusion of both movable-type systems was limited and the technology did not spread beyond East and Central Asia, however.{{Sfn | Ch'on | 1993 | p = 19}}

London: Oak Knoll Press, 1998. p. 3.</ref> This technical breakthrough was instrumental in starting the [[Printing Revolution]] and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the [[Gutenberg Bible]].

Rapidly advancing technology revolutionized typography in the latter twentieth century. During the 1960s some camera-ready typesetting could be produced in any office or workshop with stand-alone machines such as those introduced by [[IBM]] (see: [[IBM Selectric typewriter]]). During the same period [[Letraset]] introduced [[Dry transfer]] technology that allowed designers to transfer types instantly.<ref>https://www.lipsum.com</ref> The famous Lorem Ipsum gained popularity due to its usage in [[Letraset]]. During the mid-1980s personal computers such as the [[Macintosh]] allowed type designers to create typefaces digitally using commercial graphic design software. Digital technology also enabled designers to create more experimental typefaces as well as the practical typefaces of traditional typography. Designs for typefaces could be created faster with the new technology, and for more specific functions.<ref name="Clair">{{cite book|last1=Clair|first1=Kate|last2=Busic-Snyder|first2=Cynthia |title=A Typographic Workbook: A Primer to History, Techniques, and Artistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf0iDYCr6w0C|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-39988-0|pages=4, 123}}</ref> The cost for developing typefaces was drastically lowered, becoming widely available to the masses. The change has been called the "democratization of type" and has given new designers more opportunities to enter the field.<ref name=Rothenberg1990>{{cite news|last=Rothenberg|first=Randall|title=Computers Change the Face of Type|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/23/business/computers-change-the-face-of-type.html|date=23 July 1990|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

=== Evolution ===
The design of typefaces has developed alongside the development of [[typesetting]] systems.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Rob |last1=Carter |first2=Ben |last2=Day |first3=Philip B. |last3=Meggs |author3-link = Philip B.

Typographic design has been closely bound to the evolution of technology, for the capabilities and limitations of typesetting systems have posed constraints upon the design process.}}</ref> Although typography has evolved significantly from its origins, it is a largely conservative art that tends to cleave closely to tradition.<ref name="The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia">{{cite web|title=Typography|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/typography?searchId=9d3b7944-6200-11e4-9214-12c1d36507ee|website=Credo Reference/The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia|publisher=Credo Reference|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> This is because [[legibility]] is paramount, and so the typefaces that are the most readable usually are retained. In addition, the evolution of typography is inextricably intertwined with [[lettering]] by hand and related art forms, especially formal styles, which thrived for centuries preceding typography,<ref name="The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia" /> and so the evolution of typography must be discussed with reference to this relationship.

In the nascent stages of European [[printing]], the typeface ([[blackletter]], or Gothic) was designed in imitation of the popular hand-lettering styles of [[scribes]].<ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia">{{cite web|title=Type|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/columency/type/0|website=Credo Reference/The Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher=Credo Reference|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> Initially, this typeface was difficult to read, because each letter was set in place individually and made to fit tightly into the allocated space.<ref name=Infoamerica>{{cite web|title=The Evolution of Typography|url=http://www.infoamerica.org/museo/pdf/evolucion.pdf|website=Infoamerica|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> The art of manuscript writing, whose origin was during Hellenistic and Roman bookmaking, reached its zenith in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Metal typefaces notably altered the style, making it "crisp and uncompromising", and also brought about "new standards of composition".<ref name="The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia" />
During the [[Renaissance]] period in France, [[Claude Garamond]] was partially responsible for the adoption of Roman typeface that eventually supplanted the more commonly used Gothic (blackletter).<ref name="Haley">{{cite book|last1=Haley|first1=Allan|title=Typography, Referenced|date=2012|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, MA|isbn=978-1-59253-702-0}}</ref>{{rp|8}} Roman typeface also was based on hand-lettering styles.<ref name="Roman type">[[Roman type]]</ref>

The development of Roman typeface can be traced back to Greek lapidary letters. Greek lapidary letters were carved into stone and "one of the first formal uses of Western [[letterforms]]"; after that, Roman lapidary letterforms evolved into the monumental capitals, which laid the foundation for Western typographical design, especially [[serif]] typefaces.<ref name="Haley" />{{rp|10}} There are two styles of Roman typefaces: the old style, and the modern. The former is characterized by its similarly weighted lines, while the latter is distinguished by its contrast of light and heavy lines.<ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia" /> Often, these styles are combined.

By the twentieth century, computers turned typeface design into a rather simplified process. This has allowed the number of typefaces and styles to proliferate exponentially, as there now are thousands available.<ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia" /> Unfortunately, confusion between [[typeface]] and [[font]] (the various styles of a single typeface) occurred in 1984 when [[Steve Jobs]] mislabeled typefaces as fonts for Apple computers and his error has been perpetuated throughout the computer industry, leading to common misuse by the public of the term "font" when typeface is the proper term.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Experimental typeface uses ===
"Experimental typography" is defined as the unconventional and more artistic approach to typeface selection. [[Francis Picabia]] was a [[Dada]] pioneer of this practice in the early twentieth century. [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] is often associated with this movement, particularly for his work in ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]]'' magazine in the 1990s. His work caused an uproar in the design community due to his abandonment of standard practices in typeface selection, layout, and design. Experimental typography is said to place emphasis on expressing emotion, rather than having a concern for legibility while communicating ideas, hence considered bordering on being art.

=== Techniques ===
There are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design. Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast,<ref>{{Cite web|title = On Legibility – In Typography And Type Design {{!}} Learn – Scannerlicker!|url = http://learn.scannerlicker.net/2014/11/14/on-legibility-in-typography-and-type-design/|website = learn.scannerlicker.net|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref> are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them. When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for organizational strategies and demanding attractive qualities. For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Expressive Web Typography: Useful Examples and Techniques – Smashing Magazine|url = http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/expressive-web-typography-useful-examples-and-techniques/#more-60406|website = Smashing Magazine|access-date = 5 November 2015|date = 13 September 2010}}</ref>

== Scope ==
In contemporary use, the practice and study of typography include a broad range, covering all aspects of letter design and application, both mechanical ([[typesetting]], [[type design]], and typefaces) and manual ([[handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]]). Typographical elements may appear in a wide variety of situations, including:
* [[Document]]s
* [[Presentation]]s
* Display typography (described below)
* [[Clothing]]
* [[Maps]] and [[Labeling (map design)|labels]]
* [[Dashboard|Vehicle instrument panels]]
* As a component of [[industrial design]]—type on household appliances, [[pen]]s, and [[watch|wristwatches]], for example
* As a component in modern poetry (see, for example, the poetry of [[e. e. cummings]])

Since digitization, typographical uses have spread to a wider range of applications, appearing on [[web page]]s, [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[mobile phone]] screens, and hand-held [[video game]]s.

Recent research in psychology has studied the effects of typography on human cognition. The research points toward multiple applications such as helping readers remember the content better and strategically use fonts to help dyslexic readers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cognitiontoday.com/2018/05/font-psychology-research-and-application/|title=Font Psychology: New research & practical insights|date=28 May 2018|website=Cognition Today|language=en-US|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>

== Text typefaces ==
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|A specimen sheet by [[William Caslon]] shows printed examples of Roman typefaces.]]

Traditionally, text is ''composed'' to create a readable, coherent, and visually satisfying typeface that works invisibly, without the awareness of the reader. Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum of distractions and anomalies, aims to produce clarity and transparency.

Choice of typeface(s) is the primary aspect of text typography—[[prose]] [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], editorial, educational, religious, scientific, spiritual, and commercial writing all have differing characteristics and requirements of appropriate typefaces (and their fonts or styles). For historic material, established text typefaces frequently are chosen according to a scheme of historical ''genre'' acquired by a long process of accretion, with considerable overlap among historical periods.

Contemporary books are more likely to be set with state-of-the-art "text romans" or "book romans" typefaces with [[serif]]s and design values echoing present-day design arts, which are closely based on traditional models such as those of [[Nicolas Jenson]], [[Francesco Griffo]] (a punchcutter who created the model for Aldine typefaces), and [[Claude Garamond]]. With their more specialized requirements, newspapers and magazines rely on compact, tightly fitted styles of text typefaces with serifs specially designed for the task, which offer maximum flexibility, readability, legibility, and efficient use of page space. Sans serif text typefaces (without serifs) often are used for introductory paragraphs, incidental text, and whole short articles. A current fashion is to pair a [[sans-serif]] typeface for headings with a high-performance serif typeface of matching style for the text of an article.

Typesetting conventions are modulated by [[orthography]] and [[linguistics]], word structures, word frequencies, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[Phonetics|phonetic]] constructs and linguistic [[syntax]]. Typesetting conventions also are subject to specific cultural conventions. For example, in [[French language|French]] it is customary to insert a [[non-breaking space]] before a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) or [[semicolon]] (;) in a sentence, while in [[English language|English]] it is not.

=== Color ===
<!-- A disambiguation link from "Colour (disambiguation)" is anchored here. Please change the link if you change the heading. -->
{{Main|Type color}}
In typesetting, ''color'' is the overall density of the ink on the page, determined mainly by the typeface, but also by the word spacing, [[leading]], and depth of the margins.<ref>{{Citation|last=Eckersley|first=Richard|title=Glossary of Typesetting Terms|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|series=Chicago guides to writing, editing and publishing| chapter=Color|isbn = 978-0-226-18371-8 |oclc= 316234150}}</ref> Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with the [[White space (visual arts)|white space]] of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a "feel" or "resonance" to the subject matter. With [[Printing press|printed]] media, typographers also are concerned with binding margins, paper selection, and printing methods when determining the correct color of the page.

=== Principles of the typographic craft ===

Three fundamental aspects of typography are ''legibility'', ''readability'', and ''aesthetics''. Although in a non-technical sense "legible" and "readable" are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but related concepts.<ref name="Tracy1986">{{Citation | author-link = Walter Tracy| last = Tracy | first = Walter | title = Letters of Credit | year =1986 | publisher = Gordon Fraser}}</ref> Legibility and readability tend to support aesthetic aspects of a product.

''[[Legibility]]'' describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as "the quality of being decipherable and recognisable".<ref name=Tracy1986 /> For instance, if a "b" and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility.<ref name=Tracy1986 /> Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use. [[Brush Script]] is an example of a font containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using only upper-case letters (''all-caps'') reduces legibility.

[[Readability]] refers to how easy it is to read the text as a whole, as opposed to the individual character recognition described by legibility.  Use of margins, word- and line-spacing, and clear document structure all impact readability.  Some fonts or font styles, for instance [[sans-serif]] fonts, are considered to have low readability and so be unsuited for large quantities of prose.<ref name="Tracy1986" />

[[File:Oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png|thumb|'''Text typeset''' example in Iowan Old Style roman, italics, and small caps, optimized at approximately ten words per line, typeface sized at 14 [[point (typography)|points]] on 1.4 × [[leading]], with 0.2 points extra [[Letter-spacing|tracking]] using an extract of an essay by [[Oscar Wilde]] ''The English Renaissance of Art'' {{circa}} 1882]]

Legibility "refers to perception" (being able to see as determined by physical limitations of the eye), and readability "refers to comprehension" (understanding the meaning).<ref name="Tracy1986" /> Good typographers and graphic designers aim to achieve excellence in both.

"The typeface chosen should be legible. That is, it should be read without effort. Sometimes legibility is simply a matter of type size; more often, however, it is a matter of typeface design. Case selection always influences legibility. In general, typefaces that are true to the basic letterforms are more legible than typefaces that have been condensed, expanded, embellished, or abstracted.
{{Quote |However, even a legible typeface can become unreadable through poor setting and placement, just as a less legible typeface can be made more readable through good design.<ref name="Craig&Scala2006">{{Citation | last1 = Craig | first1 = J | last2 = Scala | first2 = IK | title = Designing with Type, the Essential Guide to Typography | edition = 5th | publisher = Watson Guptil | year = 2006}}</ref>}}

Studies of both legibility and readability have examined a wide range of factors including type size and type design. For example, comparing <span style="font-family:serif">[[serif]]</span> vs. [[sans-serif]] type, [[roman type]] vs. ''[[oblique type]]'', and <span style="font-family:serif">''[[italic type]]''</span>, [[line length]], [[leading|line spacing]], color contrast, the design of right-hand edge (for example, [[Justification (typesetting)|justification]], straight right hand edge) vs. ragged right, and whether text is [[hyphen]]ated. Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.

Legibility research has been published since the late nineteenth century. Although there often are commonalities and agreement on many topics, others often create poignant areas of conflict and variation of opinion. For example, Alex Poole asserts that no one has provided a conclusive answer as to which typeface style, serif or sans serif, provides the most legibility,<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}} although differences of opinion exist regarding such debates. Other topics such as justified ''vs'' unjustified type, use of hyphens, and proper typefaces for people with reading difficulties such as [[dyslexia]], have continued to be subjects of debate.

Legibility is usually measured through the speed of reading, with comprehension scores used to check for effectiveness (that is, not a rushed or careless read). For example, [[Miles Tinker]], who published numerous studies from the 1930s to the 1960s, used a speed of reading test that required participants to spot incongruous words as an effectiveness filter.

The ''Readability of Print Unit'' at the [[Royal College of Art]] under Professor [[Herbert Spencer (graphic designer)|Herbert Spencer]] with Brian Coe and Linda Reynolds<ref>{{Citation | title = Legibility of Type | first = Linda | last = Reynolds | year = 1988 | magazine = [[Baseline (magazine)|Baseline]] | volume = 10}}</ref> did important work in this area. It was one of the centres that revealed the importance of the [[Saccade|saccadic]] rhythm of eye movement for readability—in particular, the ability to take in (i.e., recognise the meaning of groups of) about three words at once and the physiognomy of the eye, which means the eye tires if the line required more than 3 or 4 of these saccadic jumps. More than this is found to introduce strain and errors in reading (e.g., Doubling). The use of all-caps renders words indistinguishable as groups, all letters presenting a uniform line to the eye, requiring special effort for separation and understanding.

These days, legibility research tends to be limited to critical issues or the testing of specific design solutions (for example, when new typefaces are developed). Examples of critical issues include [[typeface]]s for people with [[visual impairment]], typefaces and case selection for highway and street signs, or for other conditions where legibility may make a key difference.

Much of the legibility research literature is atheoretical—various factors were tested individually or in combination (inevitably so, as the different factors are interdependent), but many tests were carried out in the absence of a model of reading or visual perception. Some typographers believe that the overall word shape ([[Bouma]]) is essential in readability and that the theory of parallel letter recognition is either wrong, less important, or not the entire picture. Word shape differs by outline, influenced by ascending and descending elements of lower case letters and enables reading the entire word without having to parse out each letter (for example, dog is easily distinguished from cat) and that becomes more influential to being able to read groups of words at a time.

Studies distinguishing between Bouma recognition and parallel letter recognition with regard to how people recognize words when they read, have favored parallel letter recognition, which is widely accepted by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].{{Citation needed| date = April 2008}}

Some commonly agreed findings of legibility research include:{{Citation needed|date=February 2010 | reason = Colin Wheildon's studies oppose some of these statements. It's hard to determine the validity of the sources for these "commonly agreed findings" without any sources listed.}}
* Text set in lower case is more legible than text set all in [[capital letter|upper case]] (capitals, all-caps), presumably because lower case letter structures and word shapes are more distinctive.
* Extenders ([[ascender (typography)|ascenders]], [[descender]]s, and other projecting parts) increase [[Salience (communication)|salience]] (prominence).
* Regular upright type ([[roman type]]) is found to be more legible than [[italic type]].
* [[Contrast (vision)|Contrast]], without dazzling brightness, also has been found to be important, with black on yellow/cream being most effective along with white on blue.
* Positive images (''e.g.,'' black on white) make handheld material easier to read than negative or reversed (''e.g.,'' white on black). Even this commonly accepted practice has some exceptions, however (for example, in some cases of disability,<ref name="Trust">{{Citation | url = http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/Database/Writing/writingclearly.html | place = UK | publisher = National Literacy Trust | title = Writing clearly | access-date = 11 May 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411081228/http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/Database/Writing/writingclearly.html | archive-date = 11 April 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}} and designing the most effective signs for drivers).
* The upper portions of letters (ascenders) play a stronger part in the recognition process than the lower portions.

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The aesthetic concerns in typography deal not only with the careful selection of one or two harmonizing typefaces and relative type sizes but also with laying out elements to be printed on a flat surface tastefully and appealingly, among others. For this reason, typographers attempt to observe ''typographical principles'', the most common of which are listed below:
* Limit up to three colors, which should harmonize to each other and with the color of the paper and the dominant color(s) of the photo or graphics
* Limit to two typefaces on a single page, which should "match"
* Limit up to three fonts and sizes
* Select the size of leading to be optimal and most pleasing to the eyes.
* The number of different enhancements such as greater size, bold, italic fonts, capitalization, or different typeface, different color, as used for headlines and emphasized words inside the text block, should be limited and consistent and be judiciously selected
* Avoid underlining like pest and should not be on top of another enhancement
* Text should be placed judiciously to lead the eye from one text cognitively natural way to the next text
* Multi-line headline should be segmented by phrases (no phrase should be split into two lines)
* No [[widows and orphans]] (no beginning line of paragraph at the bottom of page, no last line of paragraph at the top of page)
* Likewise no headline is at the page bottom
* The last line of a paragraph should flush with the preceding lines and not stand alone below a picture
* The printing elements should not be scattered in the hodgepodge fashion across the page unless it truly conveys hodgepodge.
* The letters V and W at the beginning of a paragraph line should extent a little to the left of the vertical left flush line to give an optical impression of being flush with lines below.

[[File:Latex example type.svg|thumb|left|Text typeset using [[LaTeX]] digital typesetting software, often used for academic papers and journals]]
Readability also may be compromised by [[letter-spacing]], word spacing, or [[leading]] that is too tight or too loose. It may be improved when generous vertical space separates text lines, making it easier for the eye to distinguish one line from the next, or previous line. Poorly designed typefaces and those that are too tightly or loosely fitted also may result in poor legibility. Underlining also may reduce readability by eliminating the recognition effect contributed by the descending elements of letters.

Periodical publications, especially [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, use typographical elements to achieve an attractive, distinctive appearance, to aid readers in navigating the publication, and in some cases for dramatic effect. By formulating a [[style guide]], a publication or periodical standardizes with a relatively small collection of [[typeface]]s, each used for specific elements within the publication, and makes consistent use of typefaces, case, type sizes, italic, boldface, colors, and other typographic features such as combining large and small capital letters together. Some publications, such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'', go so far as to commission a [[List of type designers|type designer]] to create customized typefaces for their exclusive use.

Different periodical publications design their publications, including their typography, to achieve a particular tone or style. For example, ''[[USA Today]]'' uses a bold, colorful, and comparatively modern style through their use of a variety of typefaces and colors; type sizes vary widely, and the newspaper's name is placed on a colored background. In contrast, ''[[The New York Times]]'' uses a more traditional approach, with fewer colors, less typeface variation, and more [[Column (typography)|columns]].

Especially on the front page of newspapers and on magazine covers, [[headline]]s often are set in larger display typefaces to attract attention, and are placed near the [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]].

''Typography utilized to characterize text:'' Typography is intended to reveal the character of the text. Through the use of typography, a body of text can instantaneously reveal the mood the author intends to convey to its readers. The message that a body of text conveys has a direct relationship with the typeface that is chosen. Therefore, when a person focuses on typography and setting type, they must pay very close attention to the typeface they decide to choose. Choosing the correct typeface for a body of text can only be done after thoroughly reading the text, understanding its context, and understanding what the text is wishing to convey. Once the typographer has an understanding of the text, then they have the responsibility of using the appropriate typeface to honor the writing done by the author of the text. Knowledge of choosing the correct typeface comes along with understanding the historical background of typefaces and understanding the reason why that typeface was created. For example, if the body of the text is titled “Commercial Real Estate Transactions” and further elaborates on the real estate market throughout the body, then the appropriate typeface to use in this instance is a serif typeface. This typeface would be appropriate because the author intends to inform its audience on a serious topic and not entertain his audience with an anecdote; therefore, a serif typeface would effectively convey a sense of seriousness to the audience instantaneously. The typographer would also employ larger-sized font for the title of the text to convey a sense of importance to the title of the text which directly informs the reader of the structure in which the text is intended to be read, as well as increasing readability from varying viewing distances.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Typography: Often invisible, always essential {{!}} Insights {{!}} Larsen|url = http://larsen.com/insights/typography/|website = Larsen|access-date = 4 February 2016|language = en-US}}</ref>

''Typography utilized to make reading practical:'' Typography not only has a direct correlation with honoring the tone of the text but also shares the responsibility of making the audience commence the reading process as well as sustaining the audience's attention throughout the body of the text. Although typography can potentially be utilized to attract the reader's attention to commence the reading process and create a beautiful/attractive piece of text, the craft of typography is not limited to aesthetics. Typography is a craft that is not stringently encompassed with the aesthetic appeal of the text. On the contrary, the object of typography is to make the reading experience practical and useful. The use of bold colors, multiple typefaces, and colorful backgrounds in a typographic design may be eye-catching; however, it may not be appropriate for all bodies of text and could potentially make text illegible. Overuse of design elements such as colors and typefaces can create an unsettling reading experience, preventing the author of the text from conveying their message to readers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What Is Typography? {{!}} The Importance of Typography in Web Design|url = https://www.bopdesign.com/bop-blog/2013/07/what-is-typography/|website = Bop Design|access-date = 4 February 2016|language = en-US|date = 8 July 2013}}</ref>

Type may be combined with [[negative space]] and images, forming relationships and dialog between the words and images for special effects. Display designs are a potent element in [[graphic design]]. Some sign designers exhibit less concern for readability, sacrificing it for an artistic manner. Color and size of type elements may be much more prevalent than in solely text designs. Most display items exploit type at larger sizes, where the details of letter design are magnified. Color is used for its emotional effect in conveying the tone and nature of subject matter.

Display typography encompasses:
* [[Advertisement]]s in publications, such as newspapers and magazines
* Magazine and newspaper headline type
* [[Sign]]s and other large-scale-letter designs, such as [[information sign]]s and [[billboard]]s
* [[Poster]]s
* [[Brochure]]s and [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]]
* [[Packaging and labeling]]
* Business communications and advertising
* [[Book cover]]s
* Typographic [[logo]]s, trademarks, and word marks
* [[Graffiti]]
* Inscriptions
* [[architecture|Architectural]] lettering
* [[Kinetic typography]] in [[motion picture]]s, [[television]], [[vending machine]] displays, online, and [[computer screen]] displays

=== Advertising ===
Typography has long been a vital part of [[promotion (marketing)|promotional material]] and [[advertising]]. Designers often use typefaces to set a theme and mood in an advertisement (for example, using bold, large text to convey a particular message to the reader).<ref>Stanley, Thomas Blaine. ''The Technique of Advertising Production''. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1940. p. 40.</ref> Choice of typeface is often used to draw attention to a particular advertisement, combined with efficient use of color, shapes, and images.<ref>Stanley, Thomas Blaine. ''The Technique of Advertising Production''. New York: Prentice-Hall, 1940.</ref> Today, typography in advertising often reflects a company's [[brand]].

A brand may use typography to express its theme, personality, and message.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brand Typography: A Complete Guide|url=https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/choose-the-right-typeface-for-a-brand}}</ref> Just by looking at the typeface, viewers can get an idea about the message and personality of the brand, which the brands are fully aware of and are tapping into the power of good typography.

Typefaces used in advertisements convey different messages to the reader: classical ones are for a strong personality, while more modern ones may convey clean, neutral look. Bold typefaces are used for making statements and attracting attention. In any design, a balance has to be achieved between the visual impact and communication aspects.<ref>Glaser, C. Knight, J. ''When Typography Speaks Louder Than Words''. 13 April 2012.</ref> Digital technology in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has enabled the creation of typefaces for advertising that are more experimental than traditional typefaces.<ref name=Rothenberg1990 />

=== Inscriptional and architectural lettering ===
{{See also|Epigraphy}}
[[File:EncycBrit1913.png|thumb|left|A display advertisement for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' from a 1913 issue of ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' magazine]]
The history of inscriptional lettering is intimately tied to the history of writing, the evolution of letterforms and the craft of the hand. The widespread use of the computer and various etching and [[Abrasive blasting|sandblasting]] techniques today has made the hand carved monument a rarity, and the number of [[Letter cutting|letter-carvers]] left in the [[United States|US]] continues to dwindle.

For monumental lettering to be effective, it must be considered carefully in its context. Proportions of letters need to be altered as their size and distance from the viewer increases. An expert monument designer gains understanding of these nuances through much practice and observation of the craft. Letters drawn by hand and for a specific project have the possibility of being richly specific and profoundly beautiful in the hand of a master. Each also may take up to an hour to carve, so it is no wonder that the automated sandblasting process has become the industry standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historygraphicdesign.com/a-graphic-renaissance/printing-comes-to-europe/827-typography-2|title=Typography|website=History of Graphic Design|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

To create a sandblasted letter, a rubber mat is laser-cut from a computer file and glued to the stone. The blasted sand then bites a coarse groove or channel into the exposed surface. Unfortunately, many of the computer applications that create these files and interface with the laser cutter do not have a wide selection of many typefaces, and often have inferior versions of those typefaces that are available. What now can be done in minutes, however, lacks the striking architecture and geometry of the chisel-cut letter that allows light to play across its distinct interior planes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ruzaqir.blogspot.com.au/2007/05/typograpy-english.html|title=Typogrphy: Inscriptional and architectural lettering|website=My self and my world|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

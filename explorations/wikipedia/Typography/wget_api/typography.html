  <h2>Evolution</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">The design of typefaces has developed alongside the development of <a class="link" href="./typesetting">typesetting</a> systems.</span> <span class="sentence">Although typography has evolved significantly from its origins, it is a largely conservative art that tends to cleave closely to tradition.</span> <span class="sentence">This is because <a class="link" href="./legibility">legibility</a> is paramount, and so the typefaces that are the most readable usually are retained.</span> <span class="sentence">In addition, the evolution of typography is inextricably intertwined with <a class="link" href="./lettering">lettering</a> by hand and related art forms, especially formal styles, which thrived for centuries preceding typography, and so the evolution of typography must be discussed with reference to this relationship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">In the nascent stages of European <a class="link" href="./printing">printing</a>, the typeface (<a class="link" href="./blackletter">blackletter</a>, or Gothic) was designed in imitation of the popular hand-lettering styles of <a class="link" href="./scribes">scribes</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Initially, this typeface was difficult to read, because each letter was set in place individually and made to fit tightly into the allocated space.</span> <span class="sentence">The art of manuscript writing, whose origin was during Hellenistic and Roman bookmaking, reached its zenith in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages.</span> <span class="sentence">Metal typefaces notably altered the style, making it "crisp and uncompromising", and also brought about "new standards of composition".</span> <span class="sentence">During the <a class="link" href="./Renaissance">Renaissance</a> period in France, <a class="link" href="./Claude_Garamond">Claude Garamond</a> was partially responsible for the adoption of Roman typeface that eventually supplanted the more commonly used Gothic (blackletter).</span> <span class="sentence">Roman typeface also was based on hand-lettering styles.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">The development of Roman typeface can be traced back to Greek lapidary letters.</span> <span class="sentence">Greek lapidary letters were carved into stone and "one of the first formal uses of Western <a class="link" href="./letterforms">letterforms</a>"; after that, Roman lapidary letterforms evolved into the monumental capitals, which laid the foundation for Western typographical design, especially <a class="link" href="./serif">serif</a> typefaces.</span> <span class="sentence">There are two styles of Roman typefaces: the old style, and the modern.</span> <span class="sentence">The former is characterized by its similarly weighted lines, while the latter is distinguished by its contrast of light and heavy lines.</span> <span class="sentence">Often, these styles are combined.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">By the twentieth century, computers turned typeface design into a rather simplified process.</span> <span class="sentence">This has allowed the number of typefaces and styles to proliferate exponentially, as there now are thousands available.</span> <span class="sentence">Unfortunately, confusion between <a class="link" href="./typeface">typeface</a> and <a class="link" href="./font">font</a> (the various styles of a single typeface) occurred in 1984 when <a class="link" href="./Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> mislabeled typefaces as fonts for Apple computers and his error has been perpetuated throughout the computer industry, leading to common misuse by the public of the term "font" when typeface is the proper term.</span>

  <h2>Experimental typeface uses</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">"Experimental typography" is defined as the unconventional and more artistic approach to typeface selection.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Francis_Picabia">Francis Picabia</a> was a <a class="link" href="./Dada">Dada</a> pioneer of this practice in the early twentieth century.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./David_Carson_(graphic_designer)">David Carson</a> is often associated with this movement, particularly for his work in <a class="link" href="./Ray_Gun_(magazine)"><i>Ray Gun</i></a> magazine in the 1990s.</span> <span class="sentence">His work caused an uproar in the design community due to his abandonment of standard practices in typeface selection, layout, and design.</span> <span class="sentence">Experimental typography is said to place emphasis on expressing emotion, rather than having a concern for legibility while communicating ideas, hence considered bordering on being art.</span>

  </div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">There are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design.</span> <span class="sentence">Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast, are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them.</span> <span class="sentence">When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for organizational strategies and demanding attractive qualities.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.</span>

      <span class="sentence">Legibility "refers to perception" (being able to see as determined by physical limitations of the eye), and readability "refers to comprehension" (understanding the meaning).</span> <span class="sentence">Good typographers and graphic designers aim to achieve excellence in both.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">"The typeface chosen should be legible. That is, it should be read without effort. Sometimes legibility is simply a matter of type size; more often, however, it is a matter of typeface design. Case selection always influences legibility. In general, typefaces that are true to the basic letterforms are more legible than typefaces that have been condensed, expanded, embellished, or abstracted."However, even a legible typeface can become unreadable through poor setting and placement, just as a less legible typeface can be made more readable through good design."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Studies of both legibility and readability have examined a wide range of factors including type size and type design.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, comparing <span style="font-family:<a class="link" href="./serif">serif</a>">serif vs. <a class="link" href="./sans-serif">sans-serif</a> type, <a class="link" href="./roman_type">roman type</a> vs. <a class="link" href="./oblique_type"><i>oblique type</i></a>, and <span style="font-family:serif"><a class="link" href="./italic_type"><i>italic type</i></a>, <a class="link" href="./line_length">line length</a>, <a class="link" href="./leading">line spacing</a>, color contrast, the design of right-hand edge (for example, <a class="link" href="./Justification_(typesetting)">justification</a>, straight right hand edge) vs. ragged right, and whether text is <a class="link" href="./hyphen">hyphenated</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Legibility research has been published since the late nineteenth century.</span> <span class="sentence">Although there often are commonalities and agreement on many topics, others often create poignant areas of conflict and variation of opinion.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, Alex Poole asserts that no one has provided a conclusive answer as to which typeface style, serif or sans serif, provides the most legibility, although differences of opinion exist regarding such debates.</span> <span class="sentence">Other topics such as justified <i>vs</i> unjustified type, use of hyphens, and proper typefaces for people with reading difficulties such as <a class="link" href="./dyslexia">dyslexia</a>, have continued to be subjects of debate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Legibility is usually measured through the speed of reading, with comprehension scores used to check for effectiveness (that is, not a rushed or careless read).</span> <span class="sentence">For example, <a class="link" href="./Miles_Tinker">Miles Tinker</a>, who published numerous studies from the 1930s to the 1960s, used a speed of reading test that required participants to spot incongruous words as an effectiveness filter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">The <i>Readability of Print Unit</i> at the <a class="link" href="./Royal_College_of_Art">Royal College of Art</a> under Professor <a class="link" href="./Herbert_Spencer_(graphic_designer)">Herbert Spencer</a> with Brian Coe and Linda Reynolds did important work in this area.</span> <span class="sentence">It was one of the centres that revealed the importance of the <a class="link" href="./Saccade">saccadic</a> rhythm of eye movement for readability—in particular, the ability to take in (i.e., recognise the meaning of groups of) about three words at once and the physiognomy of the eye, which means the eye tires if the line required more than 3 or 4 of these saccadic jumps.</span> <span class="sentence">More than this is found to introduce strain and errors in reading (e.g., Doubling).</span> <span class="sentence">The use of all-caps renders words indistinguishable as groups, all letters presenting a uniform line to the eye, requiring special effort for separation and understanding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">These days, legibility research tends to be limited to critical issues or the testing of specific design solutions (for example, when new typefaces are developed).</span> <span class="sentence">Examples of critical issues include <a class="link" href="./typeface">typefaces</a> for people with <a class="link" href="./visual_impairment">visual impairment</a>, typefaces and case selection for highway and street signs, or for other conditions where legibility may make a key difference.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Much of the legibility research literature is atheoretical—various factors were tested individually or in combination (inevitably so, as the different factors are interdependent), but many tests were carried out in the absence of a model of reading or visual perception.</span> <span class="sentence">Some typographers believe that the overall word shape (<a class="link" href="./Bouma">Bouma</a>) is essential in readability and that the theory of parallel letter recognition is either wrong, less important, or not the entire picture.</span> <span class="sentence">Word shape differs by outline, influenced by ascending and descending elements of lower case letters and enables reading the entire word without having to parse out each letter (for example, dog is easily distinguished from cat) and that becomes more influential to being able to read groups of words at a time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Studies distinguishing between Bouma recognition and parallel letter recognition with regard to how people recognize words when they read, have favored parallel letter recognition, which is widely accepted by <a class="link" href="./cognitive_psychology">cognitive psychologists</a>.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Some commonly agreed findings of legibility research include:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">The aesthetic concerns in typography deal not only with the careful selection of one or two harmonizing typefaces and relative type sizes but also with laying out elements to be printed on a flat surface tastefully and appealingly, among others.</span> <span class="sentence">For this reason, typographers attempt to observe <i>typographical principles</i>, the most common of which are listed below:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Readability also may be compromised by <a class="link" href="./letter-spacing">letter-spacing</a>, word spacing, or <a class="link" href="./leading">leading</a> that is too tight or too loose.</span> <span class="sentence">It may be improved when generous vertical space separates text lines, making it easier for the eye to distinguish one line from the next, or previous line.</span> <span class="sentence">Poorly designed typefaces and those that are too tightly or loosely fitted also may result in poor legibility.</span> <span class="sentence">Underlining also may reduce readability by eliminating the recognition effect contributed by the descending elements of letters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Periodical publications, especially <a class="link" href="./newspaper">newspapers</a> and <a class="link" href="./magazine">magazines</a>, use typographical elements to achieve an attractive, distinctive appearance, to aid readers in navigating the publication, and in some cases for dramatic effect.</span> <span class="sentence">By formulating a <a class="link" href="./style_guide">style guide</a>, a publication or periodical standardizes with a relatively small collection of <a class="link" href="./typeface">typefaces</a>, each used for specific elements within the publication, and makes consistent use of typefaces, case, type sizes, italic, boldface, colors, and other typographic features such as combining large and small capital letters together.</span> <span class="sentence">Some publications, such as <a class="link" href="./The_Guardian"><i>The Guardian</i></a> and <a class="link" href="./The_Economist"><i>The Economist</i></a>, go so far as to commission a <a class="link" href="./List_of_type_designers">type designer</a> to create customized typefaces for their exclusive use.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Different periodical publications design their publications, including their typography, to achieve a particular tone or style.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, <a class="link" href="./USA_Today"><i>USA Today</i></a> uses a bold, colorful, and comparatively modern style through their use of a variety of typefaces and colors; type sizes vary widely, and the newspaper's name is placed on a colored background.</span> <span class="sentence">In contrast, <a class="link" href="./The_New_York_Times"><i>The New York Times</i></a> uses a more traditional approach, with fewer colors, less typeface variation, and more <a class="link" href="./Column_(typography)">columns</a>.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">Especially on the front page of newspapers and on magazine covers, <a class="link" href="./headline">headlines</a> often are set in larger display typefaces to attract attention, and are placed near the <a class="link" href="./Nameplate_(publishing)">masthead</a>.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence"><i>Typography utilized to characterize text:</i> Typography is intended to reveal the character of the text.</span> <span class="sentence">Through the use of typography, a body of text can instantaneously reveal the mood the author intends to convey to its readers.</span> <span class="sentence">The message that a body of text conveys has a direct relationship with the typeface that is chosen.</span> <span class="sentence">Therefore, when a person focuses on typography and setting type, they must pay very close attention to the typeface they decide to choose.</span> <span class="sentence">Choosing the correct typeface for a body of text can only be done after thoroughly reading the text, understanding its context, and understanding what the text is wishing to convey.</span> <span class="sentence">Once the typographer has an understanding of the text, then they have the responsibility of using the appropriate typeface to honor the writing done by the author of the text.</span> <span class="sentence">Knowledge of choosing the correct typeface comes along with understanding the historical background of typefaces and understanding the reason why that typeface was created.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, if the body of the text is titled “Commercial Real Estate Transactions” and further elaborates on the real estate market throughout the body, then the appropriate typeface to use in this instance is a serif typeface.</span> <span class="sentence">This typeface would be appropriate because the author intends to inform its audience on a serious topic and not entertain his audience with an anecdote; therefore, a serif typeface would effectively convey a sense of seriousness to the audience instantaneously.</span> <span class="sentence">The typographer would also employ larger-sized font for the title of the text to convey a sense of importance to the title of the text which directly informs the reader of the structure in which the text is intended to be read, as well as increasing readability from varying viewing distances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence"><i>Typography utilized to make reading practical:</i> Typography not only has a direct correlation with honoring the tone of the text but also shares the responsibility of making the audience commence the reading process as well as sustaining the audience's attention throughout the body of the text.</span> <span class="sentence">Although typography can potentially be utilized to attract the reader's attention to commence the reading process and create a beautiful/attractive piece of text, the craft of typography is not limited to aesthetics.</span> <span class="sentence">Typography is a craft that is not stringently encompassed with the aesthetic appeal of the text.</span> <span class="sentence">On the contrary, the object of typography is to make the reading experience practical and useful.</span> <span class="sentence">The use of bold colors, multiple typefaces, and colorful backgrounds in a typographic design may be eye-catching; however, it may not be appropriate for all bodies of text and could potentially make text illegible.</span> <span class="sentence">Overuse of design elements such as colors and typefaces can create an unsettling reading experience, preventing the author of the text from conveying their message to readers.</span>

  <h2>Inscriptional and architectural lettering</h2>
  <img src="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/EncycBrit1913.png?width=300" alt="EncycBrit1913"/>  <div class="text">
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">The history of inscriptional lettering is intimately tied to the history of writing, the evolution of letterforms and the craft of the hand.</span> <span class="sentence">The widespread use of the computer and various etching and <a class="link" href="./Abrasive_blasting">sandblasting</a> techniques today has made the hand carved monument a rarity, and the number of <a class="link" href="./Letter_cutting">letter-carvers</a> left in the <a class="link" href="./United_States">US</a> continues to dwindle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">For monumental lettering to be effective, it must be considered carefully in its context.</span> <span class="sentence">Proportions of letters need to be altered as their size and distance from the viewer increases.</span> <span class="sentence">An expert monument designer gains understanding of these nuances through much practice and observation of the craft.</span> <span class="sentence">Letters drawn by hand and for a specific project have the possibility of being richly specific and profoundly beautiful in the hand of a master.</span> <span class="sentence">Each also may take up to an hour to carve, so it is no wonder that the automated sandblasting process has become the industry standard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="sentence">To create a sandblasted letter, a rubber mat is laser-cut from a computer file and glued to the stone.</span> <span class="sentence">The blasted sand then bites a coarse groove or channel into the exposed surface.</span> <span class="sentence">Unfortunately, many of the computer applications that create these files and interface with the laser cutter do not have a wide selection of many typefaces, and often have inferior versions of those typefaces that are available.</span> <span class="sentence">What now can be done in minutes, however, lacks the striking architecture and geometry of the chisel-cut letter that allows light to play across its distinct interior planes.</span>
